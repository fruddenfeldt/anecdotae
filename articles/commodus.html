<h1>Emperor Commodus</h1>

<p>Rome had hundreds of emperors, and among these, Commodus is considered among the very worst</p>

<p>There were few other truly terrible emperors, and we'll get to them soon enough, 
    but what makes Commodus interesting is how great is father was. His father was Marcus Aurelius, the great 'philospher-emperor' and stoicist and author of 'Meditations'</p>

<p>But let's get back to his son, Commodus.</p>
